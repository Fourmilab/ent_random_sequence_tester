Verified that when the program is built using GCC 4.5.2 on
a x86_64 architecture, processing files larger than 2^32
bytes produces correct results.

Verified that the same results are produced when compiled
with -O3 and -g options.

Corrected a (bogus) uninitialised variable warning from
GCC 4.5.2 in -Wall mode.

Cleaned up the "check" target in the Makefile, now using the
Web page's PNG title image as the test file.

Version 1.4, re-organised for publication on GitHub.  Removed
the pre-built Win32 executable, as it has not been tested for more
than a decade and I no longer support legacy proprietary platforms.
The WIN32 code remains in the source if somebody wants to try to
get it to work.
