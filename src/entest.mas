Entropy = 7.944368 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 9267 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 9267 samples is 777.83, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 126.7298 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.170984456 (error 0.94 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.059129 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
